To create the database on database of your choice,

create a database named "pool_doctors"
run the sql create_db.sql
load customer.unl and product.unl into the customer and product tables 
respectively

TODO - shall I create a program to do this, or shall I leave it as it so users can 
modify as appropriate for databbase of their choice
